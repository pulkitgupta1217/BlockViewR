# Art Gallery Security System

For this project, I developed a virtual reality program to assemble models from Legos and then deconstruct them to build in real life.

I coded the entire program singlehandedly in 72 hours for Georgia Techâ€™s annual global hackathon (HackGT).

I also demoed the project using the Oculus Rift to a panelist of judges and to a general audience.
